**Note:** As of right now, Reverb is only available for **Linux** and **MacOS**. I will port it to **Windows** when I get a chance.

# Downloading the Latest Release
To download the latest version of Reverb, head to the "[releases](https://github.com/BlueishLeaf/reverb-lang/releases)" tab on the Reverb repository and select **"reverb"** under the **assets** dropdown for the latest release.

# Using Reverb Globally
If you wish to use the Reverb CLI globally, then you will need to install the Reverb binary to your bin directory. This can be done quite easily by running `sudo cp reverb /usr/local/bin`. To test, try typing `reverb` into a terminal instance and see if the REPL starts up.
