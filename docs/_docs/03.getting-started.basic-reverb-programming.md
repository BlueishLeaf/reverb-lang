This section will detail the basics of reverb as well as go over some of its in-built functions.

# Hello World!
Printing is as easy as calling the in-built `print` function and passing in an argument.

```
print("Hello World!")

>> Hello World!
```

## A Simple Greeter
This example demonstrates some of the building blocks of Reverb, including:
- Variable binding.
- Functions.
- The in-built function `get`, used to get user console input.

```
var greeting = fn(n) begin
    return "Hello " + n
end

var name = get()
print(greeting(name))

>> Killian
>> Hello Killian
```

## Implicit Return Type
You do not need to explicitly use the `return` keyword in a function. Reverb implicitly returns the last expression in a function.

```
var greeting = fn(n) begin
    "Hello " + n
end
```

# Working with Lists
Collections of values in Reverb are known as **lists**. They are dynamically sized and can contain values of different types.

```
var integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
var floats = [1.5, 2.4, 3.3, 3.2, 5.1]
var mixed = [1, 2, 3.3, 4, 5.1]

print(integers, floats, mixed)

>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>> [1.500000, 2.400000, 3.300000, 3.200000, 5.100000]
>> [1, 2, 3.300000, 4, 5.100000]
```

## Operations on Lists
The Reverb built-in library provides a few functions for working with lists.
### Length
The `length` function returns the number of elements in a list. **Note:** This function can also be used to return the number of characters in a string.

```
var integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(length(integers))

>> 5
```

### Head
The `head` function takes in a list as an argument and returns the value of the first element of the list.

```
var integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(head(integers))

>> 1
```

### Tail
The `tail` function takes in a list as an argument returns a new list containing the argument without it's head.

```
var integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(tail(integers))

>> [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Push
The `push` function takes in a list and a value as arguments returns a new list with the value appended to the list.

```
var integers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(push(integers, 5))

>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Iterating Over a List
Combining what you've learned so far, the below example demonstrates a simple map function that iterates over a list, executes a function on each element, then returns the new processed list. Notice how you can pass function literals around like arguments, this will be discussed in the next section.

```
var map = fn(array, func) begin
    var loop = fn(array, processed) begin
        if length(array) == 0 then
            return processed
        end
        loop(tail(array), push(processed, func(head(array))))
    end
    loop(array, [])
end

var integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(map(integers, fn(x) begin x * 2 end))
print(map(integers, fn(x) begin x * x end))

>> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
>> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
