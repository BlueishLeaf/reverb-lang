# September
The first month of development was aimed primarily at researching interpreters as well as the Go programming language.
I followed an online course to learn Go and read a book on creating interpreters.

# October
A lot of the core code behind Reverb was written in this month. In particular, the first versions of the lexer, parser, and evaluater were written and implemented.
At this point the language was very procedural in nature as I had not yet decided to go functional.

# November
This month saw further improvement to each component of the interpreter, including writing unit and integration tests for each of them. A basic CLI to interface with Reverb was written, as well as a basic audio synthesizer.

# December
No development took place during this time due to the christmas exams.

# January
Development in January was focused on implementing certain functional programming concepts such as immutable variables, first-order functions, higher-order functions, and function purity. I decided to migrate to a different audio library for the synthesizer as the old library proved insufficient for Reverb's needs.
