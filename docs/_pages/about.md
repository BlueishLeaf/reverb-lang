Reverb is a functional programming language intended for educational use. It targets those that are interested in learning functional programming but do not know where to start, or are having trouble grasping the more mainstream FP languages such as [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) or [F#](https://fsharp.org/).

Reverb aims to make learning functional programming both **easy** and **fun**. To make the transition to functional programming easier, Reverb uses an easy to read, English-like syntax similar to languages like [Python](https://www.python.org/). Reverb also has a built-in audio synthesiser that can be used to generate various waveforms. The purpose of the synthesiser is to allow for creative musical expressions though functional programming.

The idea for Reverb began in early September 2019 after I participated in the HACKMIT 2019 hackathon at MIT with a few of my friends. We created a language called [Muse](https://github.com/EoinDavey/Muse) that utilised a built-in audio sampling library to play sounds through code. I loved the idea behind Muse so much that I decided to develop a new language for my final year project that would combine my interest in functional programming and audio synthesis.
