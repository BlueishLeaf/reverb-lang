# The Reverb Programming Language Specification `14/10/19`
## Notation
Most of the specification for Reverb is written in english but lexical elements are written using Extended-Backus-Naur-Form(EBNF).
## Source Code Representation
Reverb source code is Ascii text encoded in UTF-8.
For simplicity, this document will use the unqualified term character to refer to an Ascii code point in the source text.
Each code point is indistinct; for instance, upper and lower case letters are not different characters.
